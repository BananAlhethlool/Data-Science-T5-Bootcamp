## Introduction

The first project for Data science Bootcamp T5 is called the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for the MTA dataset turnstile. Below we will shed light on the company that we cooperate to assist them with their issue, dataset description, and finally, the tools used in this project.

## Question/need:
The goal of this project is to know the most persuasive talks TED users and speakers can benefit from the modeling.


## Data Descriptions:

The dataset is a TED Talks dataset found on Kaggle that has over 4000 talks, almost all of them in English. It has a column that has the transcription of each talk. Additional features of the dataset include: "views, speaker, (speaker) occupations, recorded_date, published_date, event, available_languages, duration, (number of) comments, topics" which could be used for aggregating info/ modeling later on.

## Tools

- Technologies: Jupyter Notebook, Python, SQL and SQLlite.
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy for EDA, Matplot, Seaborn for Visualization, Scikit-learn for modeling.
